                    <p>The only prerequisite is that it makes you happy. If it makes you happy then it's good. We'll take a little bit of Van Dyke Brown. It takes dark in order to show light. Without washing the brush, I'm gonna go right into some Van Dyke Brown, some Burnt Umber, and a little bit of Sap Green. Each highlight must have it's own private shadow. Put light against light - you have nothing. Put dark against dark - you have nothing. It's the contrast of light and dark that each give the other one meaning.</p>

                    <p>Happy painting, God bless. This is a fantastic little painting. Mountains are so simple, they're hard. We'll lay all these little funky little things in there.</p>

                    <p>Fluff it up a little and hypnotize it. All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. Everything is happy if you choose to make it that way. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. In nature, dead trees are just as normal as live trees. A beautiful little sunset.</p>
